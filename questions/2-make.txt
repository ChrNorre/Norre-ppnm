1.What is the meaning of the following makefile variables: $@, $<, $^, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDLIBS.

$@ is target variable
$< is first prerequisite
$^ is all prerequisites
CFLAGS is the default flags passed to the C compiler
LDFLAGS is the default flags passed to the linker
LDLIBS is the default libraries to be linked by the linker


2. What will the following makefile print (after running command make) and why,

CFLAGS
FFLAGS
FFLAGS
-Wall -Ofast -std=c1x

because thats how makefiles work.

3. Suppose you have your whole C-program in one file main.c. Which of the following makefiles will compile and link the program into the executable file main?

all except 6. as "make" will only run the first line, and this only links.
the rest are implicit
