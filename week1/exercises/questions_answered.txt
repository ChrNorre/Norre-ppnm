1. How do you search your man-pages for a given keyword?
Hint: man man|less +/keyword -j.5

or: use "man {command}" and then type "/{keyword}". use n and N to go up and down.



2. Suppose you need to type the command basename. Which characters do you need to type in your system before command-line completion can complete your typing?

"basen-" because there are multiple called "base-"



3. In many systems command-line completion can also complete long options to many POSIX utilities. Does your shell completes long options? 
Suppose you need to type the command mkdir --parents. Which characters do you need to actually type when using command-line completion?

"mkd" and "--p"



4. How do you create a folder with a subfolder (say prog/hello)? Hint: man mkdir | grep -B1 "make parent".

mkdir prog/hello -p
-p makes sure that the parentage makes sense



5. Which option instructs the rm command to ask the user for a confirmation before every removal? Hint: man rm|grep "prompt before".

-i


6. Which option instructs the rm command to remove a folder with all subfolders? Hint: man rm|grep -B1 "remove directories".

-r, remove recursively all contents of folder and then folder itself



7. Which unix command lists the files in a directory in one column sorted by modification time with the newest last?

-c shows the time
-t sorts the list by modification time (newest first)
-r reverses the list
-l shows long information (one column)


8. What do symbols ., .., ~ mean in the context of the unix file utilities?

. is current directory
.. is upper directory (parent)
~ is the home directory (default /home/norre)


9. Where will the command cd without any arguments lead you?

cd is implicitly cd ~



10. What is your home directory? Name also alternative notations.

/home/norre
i dont like it, so i modified ~/.bashrc to include the two extra lines at the bottom:

PROMPT_DIRTRIM=2	which makes the directory header shorter
cd /mnt/c/users/chrno/google\ drev/uni/semester\ 6/prog		which puts me into my main folder

the ~/.bashrc is run whenever the terminal is opened
