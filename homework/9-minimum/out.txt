Function value is 0.000000, Gradient here is (-0.000008,-0.000015)
With an initial guess of (m0,Gamma0,A0) = (1,1,1)
The deviation function gets minimized for:
(m,Gamma,A) = (125.972, 2.08634, 9.87628)
The mass of the Higgs boson is m=125.972
Wikipedia says the real value is 125.3Â±0.6
The width of the Higgs boson is Gamma=2.08634
